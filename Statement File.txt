Project Statement: Simple Library Management System (LMS)
Problem Statement
The challenge addressed by this project is the inefficiency and unreliability of manual methods (such as spreadsheets or paper logs) used for managing small-scale book inventories. When a collection grows, tracking the real-time status of each book—specifically whether it is available or checked out—becomes cumbersome. This leads to common issues like:
1. Time Waste: Slow process for inventory audits and status checks.
2. Inventory Mismatch: Difficulty in immediately confirming a book's physical location versus its recorded status.
3. Lack of Data Integrity: No automated mechanism to prevent duplicate entries or accidental data corruption.
This project offers a simple, digital, and persistent solution to accurately log book records, enforce unique identification (ISBN), and provide instant status checks via a command-line interface.
Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to develop a functional command-line application that automates core inventory management tasks. By completing this, the project aims to demonstrate proficiency in the following key technical objectives:
1. Database Integration and Persistence: Successfully establishing durable data storage using the Python sqlite3 module to ensure all records survive application restarts.
2. Modular Programming and Architectural Design: Implementing a clear, layered structure (Data Access, Business Logic, and UI) to maximize code maintainability and scalability.
3. Business Logic Implementation: Enforcing core rules, such as preventing a book from being checked out if it is already unavailable.
4. Error Handling and Data Integrity: Implementing robust validation to prevent database corruption, particularly by enforcing unique ISBNs.
Scope of the Project
The scope is strictly limited to managing the book inventory itself via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
Core Capabilities (Functional Modules)
The system is built around three major functional modules:
Module
	Core Functionality
	I. Inventory Management
	Comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for book records (Title, Author, ISBN).
	II. Loan Status Control
	Dedicated functions for checking out and returning books, updating the status column reliably.
	III. Data & Input Validation
	Handling database integrity errors (unique ISBN constraint) and validating user inputs (e.g., ensuring Book ID is an integer).
	Exclusions (Out of Scope)
The project does not include:
* User authentication or complex security management.
* Borrower management (tracking who checked out a book or due dates).
* Advanced reporting or analytics (e.g., overdue book lists).
* A Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Target Users
The system is designed for individuals or small groups who manage a modest book collection and require a dedicated digital tracking solution:
1. Small Library Administrators: Librarians managing small collections (e.g., in a school classroom or small office).
2. Personal Book Collectors: Individuals seeking a structured, persistent way to catalog and track their own substantial collection.
High-Level Features and Non-Functional Characteristics
The user interacts with the following high-level features, supported by critical non-functional requirements:
* Usability (NFR): Utilizes a simple, numbered menu and clear tabular output for intuitive interaction.
* Book Record Creation: Allows input of Title, Author, and ISBN, coupled with Data Integrity (NFR) by enforcing unique ISBNs to prevent duplication.
* Real-time Inventory Listing: Provides instant, formatted views of all books and their current status.
* Reliability (NFR): Status changes are managed by single-step checkout/return functions, strictly controlled by Business Logic to prevent state conflicts. Data is persistently stored in library.db.
* Error Handling (NFR): The system provides specific, helpful messages for invalid record IDs, non-integer inputs, and duplicate data attempts.
